              <br>
              <p>While pesticides are invaluable tools for agriculture, pesticide use presents risks that must be carefully
                managed. The Pesticide Risk Tool is a user-friendly tool to evaluate pesticide risks using the best available
                science. It helps inform decision-making for growers and crop advisors by providing a visual snapshot of
                potential risks. The pesticiderisk.org team includes qualified scientists and its risk indices have undergone
                independent scientific reviews.

              <br>
              <p>Yes, any producer anywhere in the world can use the Pesticide Risk Tool. Its database includes thousands of
                pesticide products registered by the US EPA for use on many crops and is updated on an ongoing basis.</p>

              <p>We recognize that a subscription to pesticiderisk.org may be a significant investment for some, but we think
                that you will find value using this tool. For this reason we offer a 10 day free trial. Trial users can explore
                the Pesticide Risk Tool workspace, upload and save pesticide records and get risk scores for each of the
                13 risk indices. The Pesticide Risk Tool excel uploader, a feature that expedites the process of importing
                pesticide spray records, is disabled during the trial and reactivated for paid users. All data entered during
                the trial will be saved.</p>
